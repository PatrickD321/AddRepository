# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth. We are tasked with a list of the following to resovle and investigate this issue of irregularity.
1. Allow the school board to uphold the state-testing standards.
2. Disregard ninth grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School
3. Determine how much this action will affect the Data that was already completed
4. Present findings to Maria, her supervisor and the school board.
